# spot-albums Python Package

## Motivation

If you're like me, you love seeing all of the different artists, songs, and genres in your Spotify Wrapped towards the end of the year. Sometimes I get a shocking result that piques my curiosity. Like: when did I listen to *this* artist so much exactly?

Additionally, Spotify Wrapped (still) doesn't provide the user with a "most listened to album" section. This is especially frustrating for old-school album people like myself. Was my most listened to album OK Computer, or was it Purple Rain? What were the top 5, or top n albums I liked?

Lastly, Spotify provides its users with a killer algorithm to reccommend new music. But the album recommendation system is lacking. I can't blame the company for this 

## Getting Started

### Downloading Your Spotify Data:

1. Visit this link on Spotify's website (you will need to be logged in):

`https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/`

2. Scroll down to the secton titled: **"Download your data"**, and be sure to check the box next to **"Extended streaming history"** (else some functionality of the package won't work). ***Do not*** check the box next to **"Technical log information"**.

3. Click **"Request Data"**. Spotify will send you email confirmation to ensure that you actually want to get all of this data.

4. Patiently wait for Spotify to send you your data. It takes their systems a while to gather information to this scale (up to 30 days).

5. Once you've been sent the email, install the data onto your computer in the same directory where you will be using spot-albums in Python.
